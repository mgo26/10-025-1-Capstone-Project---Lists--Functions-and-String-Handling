Task Manager that has been adapted from code provided by Bootcamp, rewritten code in order to include functions.
Admin users can login to the application and create, edit and assign tasks to other members.
They can also use the system to create new users.
Other users can login to the system to see their tasks.

----UPDATES----
A function will be added to create the ability for users to mark the tasks as done once they are completed.
